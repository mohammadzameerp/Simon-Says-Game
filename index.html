      <h4>How to play 'Simon Says'</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Press Start to start the game.</li>
        <li>
          The game will show you a sequence of colors by flashing them one by
          one.
        </li>
        <li>Click the colors in the same order as they were shown.</li>
        <li>
          If you repeat the sequence correctly, you'll move to the next level.
          The sequence will get longer with each level.
        </li>
        <li>
          At every level, you need to remember the colors from all previous
          levels.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you click the wrong color or forget any part of the sequence,
          you'll lose the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to go as far as you can and see how long you can remember the
          sequences..!
        </li>
      </ul>
